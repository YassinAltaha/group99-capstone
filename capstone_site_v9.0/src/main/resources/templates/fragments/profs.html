					Hi, My name is Rich and I've spent my entire career working with
					software. I am currently a professor at a local college where I
					teach students how to write good, clean, well-managed code! I
					also spent many years at Microsoft where I worked with many
					great programmers and a few not so great ones. Programmers
					sometimes make the mistake of focusing too much on writing
					'clever' code and not enough on writing clean, readable,
					maintainable code. <br> <br> Over the years, I've come
					to realize is that it is a programmer's style that is the most
					important factor in getting the really good jobs. Unfortunately,
					it is the thing that is most often ignored in education! Please
					join me as we look at how to improve our programming skills and
					style in order to become the kind of programmer that companies
					will pay anything to get! <br> Currently teaching:
				<ul>
					<li>Object Oriented Programming using Java</li>
					<li>Computer Logic</li>
					<li>Developing Web Applications Using C# and ASP.NET.</li>
					<li>Capstone project supervision</li>
					<li>Web development using PHP, HTML and CSS.</li>
					<li>Various development frameworks</li>
				</ul>
